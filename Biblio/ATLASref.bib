	abstract = {The modules of the ATLAS Tile hadronic calorimeter underwent extensive tests in the test beams at CERN. Studies were carried out with electrons, muons and hadrons ranging in energy from 10 GeV to 350 GeV. The Tilecal calibration systems and energy reconstruction algorithms were also studied in great details, the associated systematics has been evaluated. The updated calibration scheme led to improved linearity and uniformity of the response.
Electrons and muons were used to set and understand the electromagnetic (EM) scale and the uniformity of the calorimeter. The pion response shows the expected behaviour with energy. The performance of the real Tile calorimeter modules to pions in terms of linearity and resolution corresponds well to that of earlier Tilecal prototype modules, after accounting for the different lengths and segmentations of the calorimeters. The experimental results are also compared to MC simulation samples.}

Therefore the electronics of the central trigger system is upgraded to allow for a larger variety and more sophisticated trigger criteria.  In addition, the software controlling the central trigger processor (CTP) has been redesigned to allow the CTP to accommodate three freely configurable and separately operating sets of sub detectors, each independently using the almost full functionality of the trigger hardware. This new approach and its operational advantages are discussed as well as the hardware upgrades.}

The ATLAS trigger system is a crucial component of the experiment, responsible for selecting events of interest at a recording rate of approximately 1 kHz from up to 40 MHz of collisions.

	journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
	abstract = {While many high energy experiments use track fitting software that is based solely on the Kalman Filter technique, the ATLAS offline reconstruction also has several global track fitters available. One of these is the GlobalChi2Fitter, which is based on the scattering angle formulation of the track fit. One of the advantages of this method over the Kalman fit is that it can provide the scattering angles and related quantities (e.g. the residual derivatives) to the alignment algorithms. The algorithm has been implemented in the new common tracking framework in ATLAS, the philosophy of which is to improve the modularity and flexibility of the tracking software. This flexibility has proven crucial for the understanding of the data from the testbeam and cosmic runs. An overview of recent results will be presented, in particular the results from the combined tracking with the inner detector and the muon spectrometer using the cosmics data.}

	journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
	abstract = {In the harsh environment of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN (design luminosity of 1034 cm-2s-1) efficient reconstruction of the signal primary vertex is crucial for many physics analyses. Described in this paper are primary vertex reconstruction strategies implemented in the ATLAS software framework Athena. The implementation of the algorithms follows a very modular design based on object oriented C++ and the use of abstract interfaces. This guarantees the easy use and exchange of different vertex fitters and finders which are considered for a given analysis. Such a modular approach relies on a dedicated Event Data Model for vertex reconstruction. The data model has been developed alongside the reconstruction algorithms. Its design is presented in detail. The performance of the implemented primary vertex reconstruction algorithms has been studied on a variety of Monte Carlo samples and results are presented.}

	journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
	abstract = {The ATLAS detector, currently being installed at CERN, is designed to make precise measurements of 14 TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC, starting in 2007. Arguably the clearest signatures for new physics, including the Higgs boson and supersymmetry, will involve the production of isolated final-stated muons. The identification and precise reconstruction of muons are performed using a combination of detector components, including the Inner Detector, comprising a silicon tracker, pixel detector, and transition radiation tracker, housed in a uniform solenoidal field, and the precision standalone Muon Spectrometer, comprising monitored drift tubes and cathode strip chambers, triggered by resistive plate chambers and thin-gap chambers, and housed in a toroidal field. In order to manage the complexity and to understand the performance of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer, a detailed full detector simulation is required and it should be kept under control by means of automatic validation procedures.
We describe the implementation and the functionalities of the recently developed MuonValidation package, which has been developed as a dedicated tool to monitor and validate the performance of the Full simulation and digitization of the Muon System. Its flexible design allows comparisons between different Muon Spectrometer geometrical layouts and different software releases. Validation results based on fully simulated Geant4 events, using the complete detailed geometrical description of the detector, are shown.}

abstract="This paper presents the electron and photon energy calibration achieved with the ATLAS detector using about 25 fb{\$}{\$}^{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}-1of LHC proton--proton collision data taken at centre-of-mass energies of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sqrt{\{}s{\}}=7{\$}{\$}s=7and 8 TeV. The reconstruction of electron and photon energies is optimised using multivariate algorithms. The response of the calorimeter layers is equalised in data and simulation, and the longitudinal profile of the electromagnetic showers is exploited to estimate the passive material in front of the calorimeter and reoptimise the detector simulation. After all corrections, the {\$}{\$}Z{\$}{\$}Zresonance is used to set the absolute energy scale. For electrons from {\$}{\$}Z{\$}{\$}Zdecays, the achieved calibration is typically accurate to 0.05 {\%} in most of the detector acceptance, rising to 0.2 {\%} in regions with large amounts of passive material. The remaining inaccuracy is less than 0.2--1 {\%} for electrons with a transverse energy of 10 GeV, and is on average 0.3 {\%} for photons. The detector resolution is determined with a relative inaccuracy of less than 10 {\%} for electrons and photons up to 60 GeV transverse energy, rising to 40 {\%} for transverse energies above 500 GeV.",

abstract="This article documents the performance of the ATLAS muon identification and reconstruction using the LHC dataset recorded at {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sqrt{\{}s{\}} = 13{\$}{\$}s=13 TeV in 2015. Using a large sample of {\$}{\$}J/{\backslash}psi {\backslash}rightarrow {\backslash}mu {\backslash}mu {\$}{\$}J/$\psi${\textrightarrow}$\mu$$\mu$and {\$}{\$}Z{\backslash}rightarrow {\backslash}mu {\backslash}mu {\$}{\$}Z{\textrightarrow}$\mu$$\mu$decays from 3.2 fb{\$}{\$}^{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}-1of pp collision data, measurements of the reconstruction efficiency, as well as of the momentum scale and resolution, are presented and compared to Monte Carlo simulations. The reconstruction efficiency is measured to be close to {\$}{\$}99{\textasciitilde}{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}99{\%}over most of the covered phase space ({\$}{\$}|{\backslash}eta |<2.5{\$}{\$}|$\eta$|<2.5and {\$}{\$}5 < p{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}T{\}}{\}} < 100{\$}{\$}5<pT<100 GeV). The isolation efficiency varies between 93 and {\$}{\$}100{\textasciitilde}{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}100{\%}depending on the selection applied and on the momentum of the muon. Both efficiencies are well reproduced in simulation. In the central region of the detector, the momentum resolution is measured to be {\$}{\$}1.7{\textasciitilde}{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}1.7{\%}({\$}{\$}2.3{\textasciitilde}{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}2.3{\%}) for muons from {\$}{\$}J/{\backslash}psi {\backslash}rightarrow {\backslash}mu {\backslash}mu {\$}{\$}J/$\psi${\textrightarrow}$\mu$$\mu$({\$}{\$}Z{\backslash}rightarrow {\backslash}mu {\backslash}mu {\$}{\$}Z{\textrightarrow}$\mu$$\mu$) decays, and the momentum scale is known with an uncertainty of {\$}{\$}0.05{\textasciitilde}{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}0.05{\%}. In the region {\$}{\$}|{\backslash}eta |>2.2{\$}{\$}|$\eta$|>2.2, the {\$}{\$}p{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}T{\}}{\}} {\$}{\$}pTresolution for muons from {\$}{\$}Z{\backslash}rightarrow {\backslash}mu {\backslash}mu {\$}{\$}Z{\textrightarrow}$\mu$$\mu$decays is {\$}{\$}2.9{\textasciitilde}{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}2.9{\%}while the precision of the momentum scale for low-{\$}{\$}p{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}T{\}}{\}} {\$}{\$}pTmuons from {\$}{\$}J/{\backslash}psi {\backslash}rightarrow {\backslash}mu {\backslash}mu {\$}{\$}J/$\psi${\textrightarrow}$\mu$$\mu$decays is about {\$}{\$}0.2{\textasciitilde}{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}0.2{\%}.",
